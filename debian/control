Description: render rich text, tables, progress bars, syntax highlighting, markdown and more
 Rich is a Python library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the
 terminal.
 .
 The Rich API makes it easy to add color and style to terminal output. Rich can
 also render pretty tables, progress bars, markdown, syntax highlighted source
 code, tracebacks, and more â€” out of the box.
 .
 Here's a list of the core functionalities of rich:
 .
  * to effortlessly add rich output to your application, you can import the rich
    print method, which has the same signature as the builtin Python function
  * Rich can be installed in the Python REPL, so that any data structures will
    be pretty printed and highlighted
  * for more control over rich terminal content, import and construct a Console
    object. The Console object has a print method which has an intentionally
    similar interface to the builtin print function
  * to insert an emoji in to console output place the name between two colons
  * Rich can render flexible tables with unicode box characters. There is a
    large variety of formatting options for borders, styles, cell alignment etc
  * Rich can render multiple flicker-free progress bars to track long-running
    tasks.
  * Rich can render content in neat columns with equal or optimal width.
  * Rich can render markdown and does a reasonable job of translating the
    formatting to the terminal
  * Rich can render beautiful tracebacks which are easier to read and show more
    code than standard Python tracebacks. You can set Rich as the default
    traceback handler so all uncaught exceptions will be rendered by Rich.
